👋 Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where bits and bytes collide with stars and galaxies! 🌍✨  
By day, I wrestle with code. By night, I gaze at the cosmos, contemplating life, the universe, and why my code won’t compile.  

🎶 Vibes While Coding:
> **"Major Crimes" - HEALTH**  
> My go-to song for deep focus, debugging, and contemplating cosmic mysteries.
